# Project Summary
To characterize prescribing patterns of Dupilumab for Atopic Dermatitis in those aged 4 to 85 by reviewing retrospective, observational, cohort study data from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) database.

Eligibility of those included is displayed below.

# Summary Statistics
## Overall By Medication
This table displays the overall summary statistics in three columns: "Did not receive", "Received Dupilumab", and "Overall". These column variables can be interpreted as if an indiviudal included was *ever* prescribed Dupilumab. Those prescribed with a diagnosis of Besnier's Prurigo were combined with those recieving an diagnosis of Atopic Dermatitis.
```{r}
label(byperson$age) <- "Age"
label(byperson$gender) <- "Sex"
label(byperson$race) <- "Race"
label(byperson$ethnicity) <- "Ethnicity"
label(byperson$condition_concept_name) <- "Diagnosis"
# Table 1 split by if they got Dup ~ever~ or not
# compare demographics of atopic derm in general vs dup demographics specifically
table1_byperson <- table1(~ age + gender + race + ethnicity + condition_concept_name | received_rx, data = byperson, rowlabelhead = "User Prevalence")

table1_byperson
```

## Multiple Prescriptions
There were no individuals that received only one prescription of Dupilumab. Each individual included had either multiple prescriptions, refills or quantities of dupilumab.

# Test Results
## Overall
We assessed whether the proportion of patients who received Dupilumab was diffferent based on patient characteristics. Each patient characteristic in the table below was assessed using logistic regression with the binary outcome of receiving Dupilumab or not. The p-values associated with multi-level categorical characteristics (race, diagnoses) were corrected for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate method (Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Reference levels include white race, non-Hispanic ethnicity, female sex, and Atopic Dermatitis as first eligible diagnosis. 

Our analysis suggests that Black patients are almost twice as likely to received Dupilumab than White patients. Similarly, those diagnosed with Atopic Neurodermatitis are almost twice as likely to have received Dupilumab than those who were diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis. Conversely, those with various forms of eczema (Flexural, Nummular and Vesicular) are less likely to have received Dupilumab than those with a most recent diagnoses of Atopic Neurodermatitis.
